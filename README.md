# fti_case_study
Hello,

Please find my main.py or main.ipynb Python scripts with a results of case study 1 excercise.
The only note I want to add that I was not able to run a solana test validator on Windows (probably should install remote linux distribution:WSL).
Due to the time limit I decided to proceed with data I've got througt solana http cluster /or from solana CLI.
Happy to further discuss those.

Best regards,
Joanna Walczewska
